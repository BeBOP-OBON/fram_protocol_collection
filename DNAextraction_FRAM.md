# BACKGROUND

This document describes the DNA extraction protocol for water samples collected on a Sterivex or other types of membrane filters. The protocol is based on the DNeasy PowerWater Kit protocol, manufactured by Qiagen (the DNeasy PowerWater Kit was previously sold by MO BIO as the PowerWater DNA Kit). The DNA extraction is based on a combined chemical and mechanical cell lysis by using PowerBead tubes.

## Summary

This document provides a change-controlled version of DNA extraction from sea water samples. Documentation of content changes (e.g. in particular tasks or safety practices) will occur via this change-controlled document, not through field manuals or training materials.

## Method description and rationale

The method used to extract DNA in this protocol is based on a combined chemical and mechanical cell lysis. Mechanical lysis is achieved by the use of the company supplied PowerBead tubes and a vortexer. Subsequently, potential inhibitors are removed, DNA is captured on a filter membrane, washed and finally eluted in TE buffer.

DNA extraction using this kit allows for high throughput and reproducibility. It is also optimized for subsequent PCR amplification of the derived DNA extract.

## Spatial coverage and environment(s) of relevance

If applicable, please specify the region where the protocol is applied. For regional term guidance see here. If applicable, please indicate here the environment(s) of relevance for the protocol, e.g. Abyssal plain. Select from the ENVO terminology.

# PERSONNEL REQUIRED

One technician or scientist can easily cover the full workflow required for the good execution of the procedure.

## Safety

Follow general laboratory safety measures (lab coat, goggles and gloves). Hazards identification: Solutions PW3 and PW4 are alcohol based solutions and therefore are flammable.

Consider the safety instructions provided in the kit (attached, can also be found on the manufacturer website: www.qiagen.com/safety).

## Training requirements

No additional training required beyond standard laboratory practices.

## Time needed to execute the procedure


Depends on the amount of samples. One of the limiting factors is the amount of samples that can be mounted simultaneously on the vortex (size of the BeadTube adapter). Normally 1.5-2 hours are sufficient to extract 6-12 samples and measure their DNA concentration.

When extracting from Sterivex filters, consider approx. 3 additional minutes on opening the filter capsule.
