# BACKGROUND

This document describes the DNA extraction protocol for water samples collected on a Sterivex or other types of membrane filters. The protocol is based on the DNeasy PowerWater Kit protocol, manufactured by Qiagen (the DNeasy PowerWater Kit was previously sold by MO BIO as the PowerWater DNA Kit). The DNA extraction is based on a combined chemical and mechanical cell lysis by using PowerBead tubes.

## Summary

This document provides a change-controlled version of DNA extraction from sea water samples. Documentation of content changes (e.g. in particular tasks or safety practices) will occur via this change-controlled document, not through field manuals or training materials.

## Method description and rationale

The method used to extract DNA in this protocol is based on a combined chemical and mechanical cell lysis. Mechanical lysis is achieved by the use of the company supplied PowerBead tubes and a vortexer. Subsequently, potential inhibitors are removed, DNA is captured on a filter membrane, washed and finally eluted in TE buffer.

DNA extraction using this kit allows for high throughput and reproducibility. It is also optimized for subsequent PCR amplification of the derived DNA extract.

## Spatial coverage and environment(s) of relevance

If applicable, please specify the region where the protocol is applied. For regional term guidance see here. If applicable, please indicate here the environment(s) of relevance for the protocol, e.g. Abyssal plain. Select from the ENVO terminology.

# PERSONNEL REQUIRED

One technician or scientist can easily cover the full workflow required for the good execution of the procedure.

## Safety

Follow general laboratory safety measures (lab coat, goggles and gloves). Hazards identification: Solutions PW3 and PW4 are alcohol based solutions and therefore are flammable.

Consider the safety instructions provided in the kit (attached, can also be found on the manufacturer website: www.qiagen.com/safety).

## Training requirements

No additional training required beyond standard laboratory practices.

## Time needed to execute the procedure


Depends on the amount of samples. One of the limiting factors is the amount of samples that can be mounted simultaneously on the vortex (size of the BeadTube adapter). Normally 1.5-2 hours are sufficient to extract 6-12 samples and measure their DNA concentration.

When extracting from Sterivex filters, consider approx. 3 additional minutes on opening the filter capsule.

# STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE

In the following SOP, please use the exact names of equipment as noted in the table above.

## Protocol

Provide a step-by-step description of the protocol. The identification of difficult steps in the protocol and the provision of recommendations for the execution of those steps are encouraged.

## DNA extraction

The following protocol is the provided protocol from Qiagen for this kit. At some points some changes are added (_marked in cursive_). They are just options we brought in to make the workflow easier or more efficient.

### Preparation

1. Warm Solution PW1 prior to use at 55°C for 5-10 minutes. Use Solution PW1 while still warm.
2. Check Solution PW3 and warm at 55°C for 5-10 minutes if necessary. Solution PW3 can be used while still warm. (_because of the brown bottle you can't see whether PW3 is precipitated or not so it is better to warm both solution. Therefore it is best to use a water bath set on 55°C_)
3. Shake to mix solution PW4 before use.

### Extraction

_In our standard operating procedure we filter samples on Sterivex filters (0.2 μm) via a peristaltic pump. So instead of step 1-3 (see Qiagen protocol below) were are doing the procedure described in the protocol [Sterivex filtration](https://github.com/BeBOP-OBON/fram_protocol_collection/blob/main/SterivexFiltration_FRAM.md)._

_After those steps you can go on with the standard protocol at step 4_


**DNA extraction protocol by Qiagen:**

1. Filter water samples using a filter funnel attached to a vacuum source. The volume of water filtered will depend on the microbial load and turbidity of the water sample.

   **Note:** Please see Types of Water Samples in the Hints and Troubleshooting Guide.
   
2. If using a reusable filter funnel, remove the upper portion of the apparatus.
           
3. Using two sets of sterile forceps, pick up the white filter membrane at opposite edges and roll the filter into a cylinder with the top side facing inward.

   **Note:** Do not tightly roll or fold the filter membrane. To see a video, please visit the DNeasy PowerWater® Kit product page on www.mobio.com.
   
4.  Insert the (_cut_) filter into the 5 ml **Bead Tube**.
5.  Add **1 ml of Solution PW1** to the Bead Tube. _(before adding PW1 it is good to rinse the used petri dish where the filter had been cutted in with
the solution to remove cells from the petri dish. Add the solution PW1 with the remaining cells to the Bead Tube)_

   **Note:** Solution **PW1 must be warmed** to dissolve precipitates prior to use. Solution PW1 should be used while still warm. For samples containing organisms that are difficult to lyse (fungi, algae) an additional heating step can be included. See Alternate Lysis Method in the Hints and Troubleshooting Guide.
   
6.  Secure the **Bead Tubes** horizontally to a MO BIO **Vortex** Adapter
7.  **Vortex** at maximum speed for **5 minutes**. _(For some samples it may be good to increase the vortexing time to 10 minutes)_. Centrifuge the tubes **4000 x g for 1 minute** at room temperature. (This centrifugation step is optional if a centrifuge with a 15 ml tube rotor is not available, but will result in minor loss of supernatant).
8.  Transfer the supernatant to a **clean 2 ml Collection Tube** (provided). Draw up the supernatant using a 1 ml pipette tip by placing it down into the beads.

   **Note:** Placing the pipette tip down into the beads is required. Pipette more than once to ensure removal of all supernatant. Any carryover of beads will not affect subsequent steps. Expect to recover between 600-650 l of supernatant depending on the type of filter membrane used.

9.  Centrifuge at **13,000 x g for 1 minute**.
10.  Avoiding the pellet, transfer the supernatant to a **clean 2 ml Collection Tube** (provided).
11.  Add **200 l of Solution IRS** (_before it was called solution PW2_) and vortex briefly to mix. Incubate at **4°C for 5 minutes**.
12.  Centrifuge the tubes at **13,000 x g for 1 minute**.
13.  Avoiding the pellet, transfer the supernatant to a **clean 2 ml Collection Tube** (provided).
14.  Add **650 l of Solution PW3** and vortex briefly to mix.

   **Note:** Check Solution PW3 for precipitation prior to use. Warm if necessary. **Solution PW3** can be used while still **warm**.

15. Load **650 l of supernatant onto a Spin Filter** and centrifuge at **13,000 x g for 1 minute**. Discard the flow through and repeat until all the
supernatant has been loaded onto the Spin Filter.

   **Note:** A total of two loads for each sample processed are required.
   
16. Place the Spin Filter basket into a **clean 2 ml Collection Tube** (provided).
17. Shake to **mix Solution PW4** before use. Add **650 l of Solution PW4** and centrifuge at **13,000 x g for 1 minute**. _(make sure that solution PW4 is mixed up quite well because it is a high concentrated salt solution!)_
18. Discard the flow through and add **650 l of Ethanol** _(before it was called solution PW5)_ and centrifuge at **13,000 x g for 1 minute**.
19. Discard the flow through and centrifuge again at 13,000 x g for 2 minutes to remove residual wash. _(make sure that there is no remaining solution on the filter membrane!)_
