# BACKGROUND

This document describes the required protocol to conduct Sterivex filtration.

## Summary

This document describes the Sterivex filtration of water samples for DNA. In the framework of the FRAM MolObs water is usually sampled with a RAS water sampler or a CTD. Water samples are then filtered on a Sterivex filter via a high flow peristaltic pump and stored at -20°C until DNA extraction. The Sterivex filtration is either performed directly on board or in the home lab.

This document provides a change-controlled version of Sterivex filtration of water samples for DNA. Documentation of content changes (e.g. in particular tasks or safety practices) will occur via this change-controlled document, not through field manuals or training materials.

## Method description and rationale

A Sterivex filter is a 0.22 μm filter within a cartridge, which reduces the risk of contamination. It can be attached to tubing to filter high volumes of sample via peristaltic pumps.
We changed the filtering method from using 0.47mm radius and 0.22μm pore size polycarbonate filters with a bottle top filtration device and a vacuum source to the filtering via perisltatic pump on a Sterivex because of different reasons. The main reason was the time needed to filter big volumes of around 10L. We reduced the time from several hours to just 45 minutes or even less (depends on the particles in the water column). An other reasons was the handling and the storing. The Sterivex filters are in plastic cases which can be locked with luer-lock stoppers and stored in 5ml tube boxes and during the filtering process the filter in the case is saver against contamination than the round polycarbonate filters.

## Spatial coverage and environment(s) of relevance

If applicable, please specify the region where the protocol is applied. For regional term guidance see here. If applicable, please indicate here the environment(s) of relevance for the protocol, e.g. Abyssal plain. Select from the ENVO terminology.

# PERSONNEL REQUIRED

One technician or scientist can easily cover the full workflow required for the good execution of the procedure.

## Safety

No additional safety rules required for you safety. Just avoid contamination of the samples by wearing gloves.

## Training requirements

To guarantee an easy and smooth liquid flow through the filter and to make sure not to brake the high flow peristaltic pump you should be introduced how to make a proper set-up with the filtering device.

## Time needed to execute the procedure

The time depends on the kind of sample (deep sea or surface water; arctic or tropical water etc.) and the volume you want to filter. You can calculate 1-2 hours for getting the water from the CTD, set-up the filtering system and filter around 10 L.
